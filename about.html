                <h1>KHIND 1.0</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                In 1961, Mr. Cheng King Fa founded "Syariket Letrik Kee Hin" in Sekinchan, operating from half a shop with basic tools to repair electrical appliances. The name Kee Hin came from the Chinese words 机 (mechanical) and 兴 (prosperity). To meet rising demand, he began producing DC ballasts in the 1960s and later partnered with his brother Cheng Hup to expand the business. By 1983, Kee Hin had established a small manufacturing facility producing a variety of electrical products. A major turning point came in 1987 when Mr. Cheng Ping Keat joined, injecting fresh energy and establishing the brand name KHIND in 1989.</p>

            <h1>KHIND 2.0</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The 1990s were a transformative period for KHIND, with a new factory opening in 1995, marked by the late Sultan of Selangor. Despite challenges like the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, PK listed KHIND on the KLSE Second Board in 1998. In the 2000s, KHIND expanded by acquiring the “Mistral” brand in 2001, entering international markets, and opening a regional hub in Dubai in 2005. By 2010, KHIND was exporting to over 50 countries and continued to diversify, setting the stage for a bright future as it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2011.</p>

            <br>
            <p>
                KHIND launched a new vision, "Delivering Happiness," along with refreshed core values—Kindness, Harmony, Interesting, Novelty, and Development (K.H.I.N.D.)—and an updated brand logo to address the needs of a younger, more dynamic audience. This rebranding reflects KHIND's commitment to quality, innovation, and social responsibility. Through the Khind Starfish Foundation, the company supports underprivileged communities and Malaysian arts and culture. Additionally, KHIND established Khind Online, a user-friendly platform offering convenient and reliable access to its products with speedy delivery, enhancing customer experience.</p>

            <p>To mark its 60th Anniversary, KHIND has focused on ensuring sustainable growth by launching a new vision, mission, core values, and updated logo. In 2021, Khind-Mistral (M) and Khind-Mistral Borneo merged to form Khind Marketing (M) Sdn Bhd, strengthening the company for future growth. As part of this new phase, KHIND Kitchen was established at the headquarters in Shah Alam to showcase its appliances and host additional activities.</p>
